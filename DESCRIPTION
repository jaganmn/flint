Title: Fast Library for Number Theory
Description:
	An R interface to 'FLINT' <https://flintlib.org/>, a C library for
	number theory.  'FLINT' extends GNU 'MPFR' <https://www.mpfr.org/>
	and GNU 'MP' <https://gmplib.org/> with support for operations on
	standard rings (the integers, the integers modulo n, finite
	fields, the rational, p-adic, real, and complex numbers) as well
	as matrices and polynomials over rings.  'FLINT' implements
	midpoint-radius interval arithmetic, also known as ball
	arithmetic, in the real and complex numbers, enabling computation
	in arbitrary precision with rigorous propagation of rounding and
	other errors; see Johansson (2017) <doi:10.1109/TC.2017.2690633>.
	Finally, 'FLINT' provides ball arithmetic implementations of many
	special mathematical functions, with high coverage of reference
	works such as the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions
	<https://dlmf.nist.gov/>.  The R interface defines S4 classes,
	generic functions, and methods for representation and basic
	operations as well as plain R functions mirroring and vectorizing
	entry points in the C library.
