Title: Fast Library for Number Theory
Description:
	An R interface to 'FLINT' <https://flintlib.org/>, a C library for
	number theory.  'FLINT' extends GNU 'MPFR' <https://www.mpfr.org/>
	and GNU 'MP' <https://gmplib.org/> with support for arithmetic in
	standard rings (the integers, the integers modulo n, the rational,
	p-adic, real, and complex numbers) as well as vectors, matrices,
	polynomials, and power series over rings.  'FLINT' implements
	midpoint-radius interval arithmetic, also known as ball arithmetic,
	in the real and complex numbers, enabling computation in arbitrary
	precision with rigorous propagation of errors; see Johansson (2017)
	<doi:10.1109/TC.2017.2690633>.  Finally, 'FLINT' provides ball
	arithmetic implementations of many special mathematical functions,
	with high coverage of reference works such as the NIST Digital
	Library of Mathematical Functions <https://dlmf.nist.gov/>.  The R
	interface defines S4 classes, generic functions, and methods for
	representation and basic operations as well as plain R functions
	matching and vectorizing entry points in the C library.
