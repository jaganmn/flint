Title: Fast Library for Number Theory
Description:
	An R interface to 'FLINT' <https://flintlib.org/>, a C library for
	number theory.  'FLINT' extends GNU 'MPFR' <https://www.mpfr.org/>
	and GNU 'MP' <https://gmplib.org/> with support for operations on
	standard rings (the integers, the integers modulo n, finite fields,
	the rational, p-adic, real, and complex numbers) as well as matrices
	and polynomials over rings.  'FLINT' implements midpoint-radius
	interval arithmetic, also known as ball arithmetic, in the real and
	complex numbers, enabling computation in arbitrary precision with
	rigorous propagation of rounding errors; see Johansson (2017)
	<doi:10.1109/TC.2017.2690633>.  Finally, 'FLINT' provides ball
	arithmetic implementations of many special mathematical functions,
	with high coverage of reference works such as the NIST Digital
	Library of Mathematical Functions <https://dlmf.nist.gov/>.  The R
	interface defines S4 classes, generic functions, and methods for
	representation and basic operations as well as plain R functions
	mirroring and vectorizing entry points in the C library.
